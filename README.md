Next Tech Lab is a student-run, multi-disciplinary lab at SRM University in Chennai and Amaravati. The lab boasts over 400 members across eight departments, working together in six research groups focusing on Artificial Intelligence, IoT, Computational Biology, Electrical Systems, Extended Reality, and Cryptocurrency. The lab has no hierarchical structure and instead prioritizes student ideas and interests. 

Next Tech Lab also has advisors from around the world, including distinguished affiliates and alumni from institutions such as MIT, University of Cambridge, and Google Brain. The lab was awarded the Silver Winner of QS Reimagine Education Awards 2018 in the Student Led Innovation domain, presented at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania.
